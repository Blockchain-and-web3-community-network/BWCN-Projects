The BWCN Hackathons are community-driven events aimed at empowering African developers, innovators, and entrepreneurs to create impactful, local solutions for Africa's unique challenges. These hackathons provide a platform for Africans to develop and showcase blockchain and Web3-based solutions that address pressing issues such as financial inclusion, supply chain inefficiencies, and access to education and healthcare. By fostering collaboration and innovation, the BWCN Hackathons aim to drive sustainable, locally-relevant technologies that empower African communities to solve their own problems.
