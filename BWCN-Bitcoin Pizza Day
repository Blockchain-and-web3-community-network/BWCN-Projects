Bitcoin Pizza Day Celebration is a community-driven event hosted by the Blockchain and Web3 Community Network (BWCN) to commemorate one of the most iconic moments in Bitcoin history—the first real-world transaction using Bitcoin, when 10,000 BTC were exchanged for two pizzas on May 22, 2010.

This celebration blends education, culture, and community, using pizza as a symbol of how far Bitcoin has come and how far it can go. It brings together crypto enthusiasts, developers, students, entrepreneurs, and newcomers for a relaxed and fun gathering featuring lightning talks, interactive demos, games, giveaways, and of course—lots of pizza.

More than a nostalgic nod, Bitcoin Pizza Day is an opportunity to deepen public understanding of Bitcoin, onboard new users, and highlight its relevance for financial freedom and inclusion, particularly in African contexts. It’s a celebration of progress, people, and the power of peer-to-peer money.
