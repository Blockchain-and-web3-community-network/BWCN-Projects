Women in Blockchain Conference is an initiative by the Blockchain and Web3 Community Network (BWCN), dedicated to amplifying the voices and participation of women in the rapidly evolving blockchain and Web3 space. This empowering event brings together thought leaders, developers, entrepreneurs, students, and advocates to explore the intersection of gender, technology, and financial inclusion.

The conference is designed to celebrate and spotlight the contributions of women in blockchain while addressing the systemic barriers they face in tech and finance. Through keynote talks, panel discussions, workshops, and networking sessions, the event fosters mentorship, collaboration, and skills development. Topics range from Bitcoin and decentralized finance (DeFi) to NFTs, DAOs, and career pathways in Web3.

More than just a conference, Women in Blockchain is a movement—creating a safe, inclusive, and inspiring space for African women to learn, lead, and shape the future of decentralized technologies.
